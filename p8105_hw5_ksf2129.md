## Problem 1

Function that randomly draws “birthdays” for each person in a fixed
group size.

``` r
bday_sim = function (n_room) {
  
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  #if number of unique birthdays is < n_room (there is a repeated bday) this will return as true
  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room
  
  repeated_bday
  
}
```

Run function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50.

``` r
bday_sim_results =
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50, #number of people in the room
    iter = 1:10000 #number of simulation runs
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim) #iterate
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result) #probability at least two people in group share a birthday (avg across simulation runs)
  )
```

Plot showing probability as function fo group size.

``` r
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  )
```

The plot shows that as group size increases, the probability that at
least two people in the group share a birthday also increases. By the
time the group consists of 50 people, this probability is close to 1,
whereas when the group consists of 2 people the probability is close to
0.
